A simple explanatory website for the K훮k훮 Database project.

## Setup

You will need to have Node >= 8 installed (and npm). Then run:  
`npm install`

## Running

To run on your local machine at <http://localhost:3000/> run:  
`npm start`

You will need to ensure that the SCSS has been compiled beforehand by running:  
`npm run watch-css`

## Building

To build the app for production use, run:  
`npm build-css` then `npm run build`

## Deploying

Ensure you have the following:

- The `awscli` Python package installed and configured with id and secret key.

To deploy to Amazon S3 (and hence make available online):  
`npm run deploy`

**This will automatically build the SCSS and source code, and then invalidate the CloudFront cache.**
